# This Portfolio

This project was built in React and styled with CSS. This app is a work and progress and will always evlove and be refactored. It was a long and hard process that I worked on individually, after coming across many errors and mistakes I fixed and learned through my mistakes and frustrations to give you something I am very proud of.

### Dependencies

I add several dependencies to my project in hopes of adding some cool features they include...

1. Email.js which allows the form to send me an email.

2. react-icons which shows all the language logos and the icons in the contact page, I imported them at the top of each page that they are in.

3. react-scroll which gives the soft scroll effect when the nav buttons are clicked on

### Viewing the App

You can clone the repo to your computer and run a `$yarn start` to see the live server.

It is also deployed through Github Pages and the link is https://niclast7611.github.io/nl-portfolio/ 

*** Note the footer is distorted on the github pages but in localhost it is fine still dont know why, I will look into it.
